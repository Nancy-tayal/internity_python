'''
Create a python program in which the user selects a particular 
range of number (example 20 to 80 or 330 to 430). The system 
should automatically select some random number and the user 
must identify that number selected by the system in minimum number of guesses. 
 
If the user identifies it in the required number of guesses then it 
should print "Yeah! You identified the number" 
 
else if the number guessed by the user is higher than the randomly 
selected number then it should print 
"Please try again! The number you guessed is too high" 
 
else if he number guessed by the user is smaller than the randomly 
selected number then it should print 
"Please try again! The number you guessed is too small". 
 
Else if the user does not guess the integer in minimum number of guesses, then it should 
give "Oops! All you chances are finished. Better luck next time!"
